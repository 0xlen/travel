> 千里之行，始於足下

在 2017 年，從沒有踏出亞洲的我，買了機票搭著飛機踏上人生地不熟的美國。雖然只是短短的幾週自由行，卻因為這次的經驗大大鼓勵我在面對任何面對的挑戰與未知時，能勇往直前。

我永遠忘不了當時旅遊出發前的緊張和興奮、曾經被移民官抓到小房間問話那內心裡慌亂不安的情緒 (只是因為緊張加上焦慮)。但回頭過來，不可否認的是，這些意料之外的經歷卻也讓我學習具備更堅韌的心態面對之後所遇到的每一件事。

旅遊內容的包裝可能實在不切實際，對於旅行，我想很難能夠在每次旅遊中充滿收穫、在旅遊中認識到能夠生死交關的朋友，每場旅遊也不可能充滿電影情節的浪漫。但也因為如此，這反倒成為我喜歡不斷探索的動機，在每一次的行走中逐步地跨出舒適圈，不免枯燥乏味，但卻是更真實的狀態。

因此，我只想給看到這裡的你，與你分享對於每一趟旅行和旅居的體悟：

> 僅管旅遊的路上可能充滿未知和挑戰，但這就是旅行對你來說最獨特之處

不管是旅行或是嘗試自己害怕的事情，只要有任何一個地方成為你勇敢邁出去每一步的理由，那我想就滿足我寫這些內容的動機了。

In 2015, I bought a flight ticket to the United States of America and it generally opened my vision to the world. I met a lot of people when traveling. The trip was a good memory and totally encouraged me to explore the world in future, no matter it is solo travel or have company.

I still remember the feeling of nervousness and anxiety when I did solo travel, which was not a good experience being asked follow-up questions in a small and dark room by an immigration officer (It wasn't violating any crime but I was too nervous). However, because of this, it is no doubt with that these experiences also help me to learn how to deal challenge with positive attitude, and put myself to be steady.

I don't believe travel can be very romantic and fun every time. It can be boring because too real. Most travel content looks fantastic, but it probably is not always right due to the content producer only showing up the good part without revealing the truth. But that's why I would like to walk through the detail, try to jump out the comfort zone when going to eveerywhere and doing everything. It can be boring, but it is more real, closing to the lifestyle that local have.
