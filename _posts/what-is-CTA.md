Notice: 由於 Policy 可能會隨著，本篇內容僅供參考，並非官方指南，具體簽證 (Visa) 問題建議，仍與您所在的國家大使館、辦事處、Ireland / UK Home office 確認。此外，在入境時，邊境移民官仍保有權利決定是否適用 (Ireland / UK Border Control)，由於在 Common Travel Area 旅遊時在邊境很大機率不會有 Passport check 跟在護照上蓋章，如果在 CTA 內旅遊，建議備妥相關資料 (例如：來回的 UK / Ireland 的機票、行程紀錄) 以確保自身的權益。

> Most non-British and non-Irish citizens who travel to the UK via Ireland must show a valid passport on arrival if they are encountered and required to present a travel document by Border Force. The passport must be valid for the whole time the person is in the UK

Hey! Welcome to Ghost, it's great to have you :)

We know that first impressions are important, so we've populated your new site with some initial **Getting Started** posts that will help you get familiar with everything in no time. This is the first one!

### There are a few things that you should know up-front:
1. Ghost is designed for ambitious, professional publishers who want to actively build a business around their content. That's who it works best for. If you're using Ghost for some other purpose, that's fine too - but it might not be the best choice for you.
2. The entire platform can be modified and customized to suit your needs, which is very powerful, but doing so **does** require some knowledge of code. Ghost is not necessarily a good platform for beginners or people who just want a simple personal blog.
3. For the best experience we recommend downloading the Ghost Desktop App for your computer, which is the best way to access your Ghost site on a desktop device.


Ghost is made by an independent non-profit organisation called the Ghost Foundation. We are 100% self funded by revenue from our [Ghost(Pro)](https://ghost.org/pricing) service, and every penny we make is re-invested into funding further development of free, open source technology for modern journalism.

The main thing you'll want to read about next is probably: [the Ghost editor](https://demo.ghost.io/the-editor/).

Once you're done reading, you can simply delete the default **Ghost** user from your team to remove all of these introductory posts!
